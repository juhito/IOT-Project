/*

Writing Data

The user must write the provided values to the corresponding data node. Subsequent writings always include 
the same name and path to write to the same data node. 

Name -> A short description of the datanode. A deviceâ€™s datanode is uniquely identified with its name and path. 
        The value is case insensitive.

V -> The value to be written. This must be applicable to the datatype, if provided.

dataType -> When the datatype is not provided, the possible data type is inferred from the value first received by the server.

unit -> The unit associated with the data, preferably 1 or 2 characters.

ts -> Unix Timestamp. The number of milliseconds since the Epoch. When a timestamp is missing, the current timestamp is automatically used.

{
    "name": "Latitude",
    "v": 63,
    "ts": 1414488510057,
    "unit": "c",
    "dataType": "long" 
},
